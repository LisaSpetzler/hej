               Welcome to the Digital Media hybrid experience at HfK + University Bremen. ðŸš€ <br /><br />
               Glad you found this cybernetic place, perhaps you might already know it, but things have changed: 
               You can now switch between the familiar first semester info and our brand-new digital media oriented Corona info page. 
               So this is the place where everything is collected regarding pandemic digital media: 
               how do I get into the studios?  Excuse me: Workshops? And still: What the fuck does hybrid mean? 
               Have a look below for the links and information you need. 
               Otherwise just ask!  <br /><br />
                <br />
                
                <StaticFilterToggle />
            </p>
